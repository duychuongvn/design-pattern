     * Benefits are: -- loosely-couples the client (i.e. ShoppingBasketBuilder class) from Items such
     * as CD, Book, and Cosmetics etc. In future if we need to create a Book item, which is imported,
     * we can easily incorporate this by adding a new item.TYPE_BOOK_IMPORTED and subsequently adding
     * following piece of code as shown:
     * <p/>
     * else if(itemType == TYPE_BOOK_IMPORTED){
     * item = new Book(description, qty,price);
     * item.setIsImported(true);
     * }
     * <p/>
     * -- It is also possible to create an object cache or object pool of our items instead of creating a new instance
     * every time without making any changes to the calling class.
     * -- Java does not support overloaded constructors which take same parameter list. Instead, use several factory methods.
     * E.g. getImportedItem(int itemType, String description, int qty, double price), getTaxedItem (int itemType â€¦.) etc
